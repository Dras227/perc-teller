# percentage value teller

This app is created for my sister who wants to calculate x% of y very frequently (for her job) and dont know how to do that(forgets everytime).

It fully uses JS (prompt and alert) to take values and display output cz i dont know how to take int input to js yet.

eg. total value: 275
      percentage: 75 
      
      75% of 275 is 192.5

contributions and suggetions are always welcome
